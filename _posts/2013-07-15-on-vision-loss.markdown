Losing your eyesight feels really shitty. Scariness aside, it's immensely frustrating dude! You feel yourself squinting a lot more often than ever before, and eventually you get tired of not being able to clearly see at a distance that you once were able to.

What makes this all worse is that your livelihood depends on creating great work that requires countless hours staring at computer screens to produce. One would find themself in bit of a pickle here. It's daunting to even think about what the future could look like…

Think about it -- do you have to learn braille? Does the artist in you simply fade away? Where does one get books about UX in braile? Audiobooks? I started to run my fingers along my jeans to see if my fingers were sensitive enough for that…

Then you realize that you have about forty good working years left in you… then you start thinking about Lasik and how they have to cut your eye open while awake and you can see the whole thing! And after all of these painful thoughts, you realize that you don't have health insurance, and you will in fact go blind one day. Maybe. I don't know.

Who needs vision anyways?
