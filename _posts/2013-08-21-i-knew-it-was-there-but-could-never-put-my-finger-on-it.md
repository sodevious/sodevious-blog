My mind is racing, and clouded with confusing thoughts. At the bottom of my stomach is this undying feeling that I've done something wrong, and there's nothing I can do to fix it. Everything feels like it's crashing down on me all at once. I can't breathe.

I wrote that last night, when someone who I recently started to get close to informed me that they could not be around me because *I lower their self esteem. I made them seem as if they should be apologetic for being themselves.* To me, this was confusing, but deep down I knew it was true. I knew my actions and words were not as they should have been in a normal situation. This person assumed that I thought they were *"a loud, obnoxious clown"*. The truth is that [I am sensitive to loud repetitive noise](http://www.autism-help.org/story-adult-sound-sensitivity.htm). In addition to that, I enjoy long one-on-one conversations because socializing with many people in large environments is kind of difficult for me and requires a lot of thought and preparation. Simple one-on-one conversations are a lot easier, and I don't feel as judged by my quiet and shyness. 

I like the TV low, and sometimes get scared by loud noises. I can't apologize for that. What really got to me, was that I didn't communicate this affliction properly enough, and thus hurt someone's feelings in the process. This entire situation that I found myself in felt familiar. I had gone through this before.

A few years ago, in my earlier teenage years I remember big fights with my mother. I shrugged these off as simple teenage emotions, I mean *who doesn't fight with their parents?* My actions back then were that of someone who lacked empathy and disregarded emotions of others, particularly people I was really close to, as my mother. I don't know why I treat people badly like that. I know that I am not a bad person. I think that because I feel comfortable with them, that I don't consciously make an effort to socialize in such a way that was "appropriate". Since then, my life has been entirely focused on my work, and personal relationships were limited to immediate family and connections made through networking. 

Networking… I remember being about fourteen and realizing that I had to learn how to talk to people if I ever wanted a career doing what I loved. I remember going from completely beating myself up for saying something wrong in a conversation to letting go, and making a conscious effort to focus on the positive instead of the negative after a social interaction. 

When I fought with my mom, I'd hear things like "If you aren't nice to people then they won't want to spend time with you". I didn't think that the things I was saying and doing were wrong, almost inhuman.

> Those around me tried to help; I have so many emails from my grandmother telling me that I had to work on my communication skills, etc. At the time, I was [so focused on my work](http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/6/4399468/autism-tech-jobs-unemployment-crisis-solution) that I didn't internalize what was going on around me: I was destroying relationships with people that loved me.



Five months ago, I discovered a [TED talk by Temple Grandin](http://www.ted.com/talks/temple_grandin_the_world_needs_all_kinds_of_minds.html). I remember the exact moment when I realized that I was not alone. I was at work, listening to various podcasts and TED talks as I sometimes did when music didn't appease me. I had shrunk the video to something like 50%, and moved it to the corner of my screen while working on developing a prototype for a web app. I started crying. I wasn't sad, but relieved. I was glad that other people shared the parts of me that were more than just "different". 

Could I lie somewhere on the autism spectrum? Could I have Aspergers?

Maybe.

If there was an official diagnosis, I think that it would open many doors for me to learn how to better effectively "be me". I made it this far, but I guess this far isn't far enough. I'm not one to make excuses for myself. I own every action I make and everything I say, even if it comes out wrong. Man, it always comes out wrong though. When I bring up the possibility of maybe having something like Aspergers, people just tell me "You don't have that", "There's nothing wrong with you". I don't know why this is the case… Having autism doesn't make you any less of a person. It could even be empowering.

I can't explain why I am who I am, but maybe learning more about autism and aspergers will give me tools to be better able to communicate and socialize. Yes, obviously I do socialize and communicate with others now. Is it effective? Do I leave early? Do I sit there most of the time on my own with a drink in my hand? Do I listen more than speak? 

Yes.

Being different isn't a bad thing. **I love myself and all of my quirks.** And it's because I wan a future, that I want to learn how I can have one. 

**Being normal is overrated.**
