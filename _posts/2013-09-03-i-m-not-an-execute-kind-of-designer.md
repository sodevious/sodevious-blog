title: "I'm Not An 'Execute' Kind Of Designer"

Recently, I've realized that my responsibilities as a designer are to deliver the best product possible. This includes making decisions that are driven by data and feedback, rather than by opinions. If you choose to accept that "feedback" as an order, then who are you really? Are you still a "designer"?

This realization came about when I was working at a startup environment (Feb 2013) where my opinions were not valued. I was seen only as someone whose job was to turn wireframes into pretty pixels and code. By the end of the contract, I was incredibly frustrated with the way things were. I didn't have the vocabulary and know-how to get my points across, so the non-technical co-founders didn't understand me. They also didn't value UX, or feedback from users. All they wanted was for me to accept their mockups (the ones that they created) as they were, and execute on them. Being so mad the whole time in that job made me see that this was not the person I wanted to be. Their way just wasn't the right way to manage designers.

Now, I'll gladly sit and work with you to solve a problem through design, but I won't do whatever you say for the sake of your opinion. The fact that you "hired me" means nothing against my practical experience at doing my job.

If you hire me to do a job, I expect that you'll trust me to do it the right way. It's not even a matter of questioning my decision making - it's more of a "I know better than to let you tell me what to do for the sake of your product".

("You" generally referring to the hiring party or someone who is not a designer or developer.)

"But Nicole, I know what's best for my business!"

I'm passionate about what I do, and that means that I have the best interest of your product and company in mind. As a part of the company, you are a super-user of the product, whereas your users are generally not. We should be designing for them, not for you.
