Don't just live the life. Joy is best experienced while living in the moment. But the moment is never still. Keep chasing. Keep working. Stop only when you cannot move your limbs. Make every effort to be the Nicole that you'd be proud of on your death bed. Joy, happiness, and love will be had, but don't create reasons for great things to be gone from you. 

Self, I am sorry. I am sorry for letting you experience a glimpse of what it's like to live a normal life. I'm sorry for not defining goals. I'm sorry for letting trival matters get in the way. I'm sorry giving you the right to be lazy on the weekends and make excuses for downtime that never used to be so.

You're not normal, and this will not be your life. Don't let it be your life. Others may be okay with complacency and stillness, but you are not. You will work harder, smarter and better than ever before until every mountaintop is defeated. Even if there's too much fog to see what's next. 

I have faith.
